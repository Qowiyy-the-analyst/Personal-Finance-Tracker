# Personal-Finance-Tracker
A lot of people find it hard to manage their  personal finance, **how they get their money, where they spend it, how much they truly save, and whether their spending aligns with their financial goals.** Manual tracking is often inconsistent, error-prone, and time-consuming, leading to poor financial visibility and decision-making.

This is the motive behind building this Personal Finance Tracker. It was designed to solve these challenges by providing a structured, automated, and insight-driven approach to managing personal finances. It transforms raw transaction entries into clear financial insights, enabling users to track income, control expenses, and assess their overall financial health with confidence.


## Objective

1. Lack of visibility into income, expenses, and savings  
2. Manual tracking processes that result in errors and incomplete records  
3. Difficulty analyzing spending behavior over time  
4. Absence of a centralized view of financial performance  
5. Limited ability to make informed, data-driven financial decisions  


## System Approach
